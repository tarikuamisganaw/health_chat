Health and Wellness Chatbot

This is a chatbot designed to provide tips and advice on healthy living, fitness, nutrition, and overall wellness. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, combining preloaded health and wellness documents with a powerful language model to answer your questions. The chatbot delivers concise and practical wellness guidance to help you live a healthier lifestyle.
Features:

    Health and wellness tips: Provides suggestions on topics like hydration, exercise, sleep, mental well-being, and nutrition.
    Contextual responses: Uses document retrieval and an LLM to answer based on provided health tips.
    Fallback for unknown queries: If the question cannot be answered from the context, it responds with “I don’t know the answer to that. Please ask another question.”
